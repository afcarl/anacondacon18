# What You're Missing Out on in TensorFlow

I'll discuss three popular high-level APIs that improve your TensorFlow development experience. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of:

- What TensorFlow is, and why it's a popular ML framework
- The benefits of reading in data using the tf Datasets API (plus a bit about functional vs object oriented programming)
- What TensorFlow Estimators are, and how to use them
- What eager execution is, and how it expedites debugging


The accompanying deck for this talk is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vE4jGlGjFBC_PIkDJyhUAHBzRyDL-BgoBuEXbO6c944/edit?usp=sharing)

An example notebook for eager execution via the TensorFlow docs is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/eager.ipynb)
